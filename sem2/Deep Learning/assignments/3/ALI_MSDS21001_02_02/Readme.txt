Structure: 
There is one code files (MSDS21001_02_02.py) a folder 'Saved Models' containg two models. One for mobilenet block architecture and other for convolution block architecture. It also contains a report.pdf file which contains results and plots of different experiments. 


Requirements:
 	- code requires that dataset(MNIST) is present in the same folder, both test and train subfolderls in the same folder. 
	- install all libraries 

How to run?
	- Code can be run from cmd and requires no command line argument. 
	- the hypermaters like learning rate, batch size, epochs can be changed from the code. 
	- The codes is generic. You can change the architecture to verify it as well. 
	- some of code lines are commented out. These lines were used to create different plots.
