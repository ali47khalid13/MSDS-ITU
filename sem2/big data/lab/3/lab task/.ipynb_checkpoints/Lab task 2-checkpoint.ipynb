    "### Lab Task: Cassandra Practice \n",
    "#### To Do Steps:\n",
    "1. Create a keyspace with simple strategy and repliccation factor of 2\n",
    "2. Create a column family that can store the following information of a student \n",
    "<ul><li>Student Roll Number</li>\n",
    "<li>Student Name</li>\n",
    "<li>Enrolled Course (Each student can have multiple courses)</li>\n",
    "<li>Semester (E.g Spring 2022)</li>\n",
    "<li>Percentage of Marks Obtained By Students in Each Enrolled Course</li>\n",
    "<li>Grade Obtained By Students in Each Enrolled Course</li>\n",
    "<li>GPA Obtained By Students in Each Enrolled Course</li>\n",
    "<li>If a student is Fresh or Repeating the Course</li></ul>\n",
    "3. Now insert data of 5 Distinct and none or 1 with repeatation for each student \n",
    "4. Thier should be data of atleast 10 students\n",
    "5. Now you have to explore following insights from data\n",
    "<ul><li>Display semester wise students in a sorted way. For example all student in Spring 2022 sorted on the basis of percentages they obtained.</li>\n",
    "<li>Display only students that are enrolled in specific semester.</li>\n",
    "<li>Display only students that are enrolled in specific course.</li>\n",
    "<li>Students having grade 'A' in a specific course in a given semester. (For example I want to see who scored 'A' in Deep Learning)</li>\n",
    "<li>Students who are repeating specific course in a given semester.</li>\n",
    "<li>Total Number of students who are repeating specific course in a given semester.</li>\n",
    "<li>In which course a student obtained maximum or minimum percentange.</li>\n",
    "<li>Can you calculate the CGPA of each student using the data you created.</li></ul>"
